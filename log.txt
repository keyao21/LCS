- working divergence calculations of velocity field and comparisons for different resolutions 
- documentation of divergence calculation

3/30/2018
(2 hrs) 
- documentation of bilinear interpolation and its implementation on current working double gyre code (in /docs)

3/28/2018
(3 hrs) 
- tried to get divergence of velocity fields, still stuck

2/7/2018
(2 hrs)
- started coding up FTLE implementation with focus on OOP and flexibility of parameters, such as dimension size and resolution
 
2/9/2018
(7 hrs)
- finished constructing FTLE class with map creater and plotter. set optional arguments for better testing capabilities
- tested mapper and plotter for various resolutions and compared time 
- created getEstimatedVelocity function to test discretized velocity fields and get "unknown points" of velocity by using velocity information of nearest point with known velocity information
- currently working on using binlinear interpolation to find velocity for "unknown points"

2/10/2018
(2 hrs)
-completed working bilinear interpolation implementation and testing information loss effects for various resolutions
